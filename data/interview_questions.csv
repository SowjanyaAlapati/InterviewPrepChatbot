What is a CNN and where is it used?,Convolutional Neural Network uses convolution layers for spatial feature extraction; used in image/video tasks.,AI,"CNN,convolution,feature-extraction,image-recognition"
What is the difference between a process and a thread?,Process = independent execution unit with own memory; thread = lightweight within a process sharing memory.,OS,"process,thread,memory,concurrency"
What is deadlock and how can it be prevented?,"Deadlock: cyclic waiting for resources; prevent by resource ordering, timeouts, deadlock detection, avoiding hold-and-wait.",OS,"deadlock,prevention,resource-ordering"
Explain virtual memory.,Technique to give processes the illusion of large contiguous memory using paging and swap; enables isolation and convenience.,OS,"virtual-memory,paging,swap,isolation"
What is context switching?,Saving and restoring CPU state to switch between processes/threads; overhead impacts performance.,OS,"context-switching,CPU-state,overhead"
"Describe scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin).",FCFS: first-come; SJF: shortest job first (optimizes avg waiting time); RR: time-slicing for fairness.,OS,"FCFS,SJF,Round-Robin,scheduling"
What is paging?,Memory management scheme dividing memory into fixed-size pages and mapping to frames; avoids external fragmentation.,OS,"paging,pages,frames,fragmentation"
What is the time complexity of binary search?,O(log n) for searching in a sorted array (divide and conquer).,Algorithms,"binary-search,log-n,sorted"
Explain dynamic programming.,Optimization technique that stores subproblem results (memoization/tabulation) to avoid recomputation.,Algorithms,"dynamic-programming,memoization,tabulation"
Describe QuickSort algorithm.,"Divide-and-conquer: pick pivot, partition, recursively sort partitions; average O(n log n), worst O(n^2).",Algorithms,"quicksort,partition,pivot,complexity"
What is a hash table?,"Data structure mapping keys to values using hash function; average O(1) lookup, handle collisions with chaining/open addressing.",Algorithms,"hash-table,hash-function,collision"
Explain Dijkstra's algorithm.,Shortest-path algorithm for non-negative weights using greedy selection of the closest node and relaxation.,Algorithms,"dijkstra,shortest-path,relaxation"
Difference between BFS and DFS.,"BFS explores level-by-level (queue), DFS explores depth-first (stack/recursion); use cases differ by problem type.",Algorithms,"BFS,DFS,queue,stack"
What is the GIL in Python?,Global Interpreter Lock allows only one native thread to execute Python bytecode at a time; affects CPU-bound multi-threading.,Python,"GIL,multithreading,CPython"
List differences between list and tuple in Python.,"List is mutable, tuple is immutable; tuple can be used as dict keys; list has more methods.",Python,"list,tuple,mutable,immutable"
